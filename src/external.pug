					* Custom Analysis Module Configuration
					* This section provides the opportunity to define additional custom analysis modules.
					* The modules are dependent on gfw widgets registered to the GFW API, so if you would
					* like to define a custom module, you must first create a widget and register it.
					*
					* (we probably will NOT use the value property. we will just loop through all analysisModules
					* and create a dropdown option for each if they have all of the required properties. maybe they have an order to sort them? This also
					* means that all of the standard analyses will get their own entry in this array.)
					* @property {string} value - a unique value for this analysis module
					* @property {string} label - the label for the analysis in the dropdown
					* @property {string} group - what group this analysis belongs to (maybe this is how we can differentiate
					* the 'standard' analyses any thing with group 'standard' will not be required to have a widget
					* until we get widgets for all of them)
					* @property {string} widgetId - the widgetId from the gfw-api
					* @property {string} queryUrl - the url to query for the analysis data
					* @property {object[]} params - any params to pass along with the query url
					* @property {string} params[].key - query param key
					* @property {string} params[].value - query param value
					*
					* (geostore is automatically appended with each request)
